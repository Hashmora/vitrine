// Vitrine Addon in MediaRemoteUI, the lock screen's Canvas below iOS 26: MediaRemoteUI draws the lock screen's player
// and, when its cover is tapped, the large cover over the lock screen, in a window of its own
// (MediaRemoteUI.SecureWindow, full screen) holding MediaRemoteUI.CoverSheetBackgroundView: an MTKView for the coloured
// field and the large MRUArtworkView, 352pt on a 414pt phone. The player's own small
// cover is in its other window, and the system takes it away as the large one opens.
//
// While the large cover is open, Spotify's switch is on (kSGRelayLockArtOn) and SpringBoard has shared the song's clip
// (kSGRelayLockClipShared, SGLockSharedClipPath), the large cover is hidden and the clip shown full screen in its place,
// over the field (LockClipView.h), and SpringBoard is told (kSGRelayLockShowing) to hide the widgets under the clock.
// A clip that comes later takes the cover's place as it comes; with none the system's cover stays as it is, and closed,
// everything of the system's comes back. The clip holds still while the song is paused.
//
// MediaRemoteUI gives the large cover its alpha back as it animates (the cover would stay over the clip
// until the screen had gone off and on a few times), so a hidden cover keeps alpha 0 whatever it is set to, and gets the
// last alpha MediaRemoteUI asked for back. A tap that closes the large cover (the field's own, heard alongside it) gives
// the cover back at once, for MediaRemoteUI to shrink it into the player as it does with no clip, and fades the clip out
// over it: hidden, the cover had nothing to shrink and the clip went at once.
//
// A song with no clip gets its still cover the same way, the screen's width across on the bands of its edges' colours,
// while Spotify is what plays: the cover from MediaRemote's now playing info, as the lock screen's own player has it.
// While the screen is dark the clip is not read or decoded (com.apple.springboard.hasBlankedScreen), and lit it starts
// over on a new display layer.
//
// A new song changes what is drawn only once it has something to draw: until its cover is in (the now playing info
// comes first with none, or with Spotify's gray placeholder picture, looksLoaded) or its clip is shared, the last song's clip or cover stays,
// rather than the system's gray placeholder showing for a moment. If neither is in after kWait, whatever the song has
// is drawn, the placeholder too.
//
// With the lyrics switch on (kSGRelayLockLyricsOn), a button puts the song's lyrics over the Canvas, dimmed under them,
// and takes them away again (LockLyricsView.h); SpringBoard keeps which of the two was picked. The button sits in the
// lock screen player's own header, in the place of its small cover, which the large one has taken while it is open: the
// lyrics and the Canvas are behind the lock screen's player and notifications, which cover anything put there and take
// its touches. MediaRemoteUI draws that player too, in a window of its own: MRULockscreenView, its header
// MRUNowPlayingHeaderView with the small cover's room before MRUNowPlayingLabelView's labels (14 to 55 pt of a 386 pt
// player on an iPhone 11). Closed, the large cover gives the small one back and the button goes. It is dim and does
// nothing for a song without timed lines, and the Canvas shows. The lyrics scroll by hand and a tap on a line seeks the
// song (kSGRelayLockLyricsSeek); under them the Canvas goes to a dark blur, so the words read on any clip.
//
// The field takes no touches: its window is behind SpringBoard's cover sheet, whose notification list gets them, scrolls
// the player with them and closes the large cover on a tap. So the field says where the lyrics and the clip are
// (kSGRelayLockGestureArea), SpringBoard catches the touches over the lyrics (LockCover.x), and their drags and taps come
// back here (kSGRelayLockGesturePan, kSGRelayLockGestureTap): the lyrics scroll and seek, and the cover closes only on a
// tap on the clip or cover itself with the lyrics off.
//
// Only the large cover's view and the cover itself are hooked, as they lay out, come and go and take an alpha.
//
// Nothing of UIKit is made in the constructor, which dyld runs before UIKit has launched: a view made there waits on
// the launch that waits on it (lyricsView() is only called from the main queue once the app runs).
//
