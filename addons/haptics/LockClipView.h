// The clip view of Vitrine Addon's lock screen Canvas (MediaRemoteUICanvas.x): the song's clip fitted whole to the
// view's width, the bands above and below it in its first frame's edge colours and its own top and bottom fading into
// them, so no edge of it shows, as a redesigned album's page runs on in its cover's colour. It plays with no AVPlayer,
// which takes an audio session the system counts as playback and paused Spotify for: its frames are read from the file
// (AVAssetReader, the video track alone) and handed to an AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer on a timebase of its own, looped,
// held still while the song is paused.
//
// Threading: main thread; the frames are read on a queue of its own.
