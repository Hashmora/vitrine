// Redesign: the header of the AI playlist's chat on glass.
//
//   AI playlist   AIPlaylist_PlaylistCreationPageImpl.PlaylistCreationView: the header row's
//                 "Abort Playlist Creation" cross, and the "Close Chat" cross that takes its place once the chat has
//                 started, become glass circles, as the cross of Create cover art is (CoverArt/CoverArt.x).
//                 "Cancel" (shown in the cross's place while the playlist is being made) is a glass capsule and the
//                 row's "More Options" ⋯ at the other corner a glass circle. The ⋯ is
//                 32 x 32 at (346, 12) in the row, 2pt higher than the cross's centre, and is moved down by that much. It is
//                 dimmed to 0.4 until the chat has started, and glass drawn under a button's fading alpha is drawn wrongly
//                 (Kit/SGRGlass.h, SGRShowGlass), so its glass is shown only while the button is not dimmed.
//                 The chat below the header (message, cards, field, the black behind them) is AIPlaylistChat.x, the popup
//                 the ⋯ opens AIPlaylistMore.x.
//
//   Onboarding    the first screen, "Your playlist playground awaits": a plain container the size of
//                 the screen that is the page's sibling, over it, holds the story and its own cross, "Components.UI.OnboardingView.CloseButton",
//                 a Tertiary button 48 x 48 at the corner. It is not inside the page, so the page's passes never met it and it
//                 showed as Spotify's bare cross, 4pt left of and 6pt above the header row's (that button is 48 x 52 at (4, 4) in its row).
//                 It gets the same glass circle, and is moved by that much so the cross does not jump when the chat begins.
//
// Both are Encore Tertiary buttons of the same frame, one shown at a time by Spotify, so each carries its own glass and
// the hidden one's goes with it. The button keeps its action and its accessibility: the glass is its own subview
// (Kit/SGRGlass.h). Nothing between the button and the page clips: the glass is 44pt inside a 48 x 52pt button, and
// the grown glass of a press (SGGlassInteractive) would be cut off at the button's edge if the button did, so the
// button and the plain views above it, up to the page, are let go of their clip.
