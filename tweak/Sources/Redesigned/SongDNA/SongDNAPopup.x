// SongDNA redesign: the contributor's pop-up on glass. Tapping a contributor on the map opens a card over it
// (SongDNA_MapKit.DNAPopupView): a #1F1F1F rounded card, r=16, holding the contributor's name with a chevron at its
// trailing edge, a two-line story, and the "View 81 songs together" button (an Encore Secondary,
// id=dna-blend-button-cta).
//
// The card's grey goes and a glass pane of the sheets' body (SGRThickenSheetGlass, as the redesign's dialogs have)
// stands behind its content; the chevron gets a glass circle of its own behind it, and the button is made a glass
// capsule. Nothing of Spotify's is replaced, so the name still opens the contributor and the button still plays the
// blend.
//
// The card is laid out and painted after it is attached, so the pass runs from its layout and again a moment later.
// The little arrow (SongDNA_MapKit.ArrowView) that points from the card at the contributor is left as Spotify draws it.
