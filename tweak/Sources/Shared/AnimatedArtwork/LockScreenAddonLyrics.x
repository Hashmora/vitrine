// The lyrics over the lock screen's large cover below iOS 26, with a jailbreak (SGKeyLockCoverLyrics): Vitrine Addon
// draws them in MediaRemoteUI over the Canvas (addons/haptics/MediaRemoteUICanvas.x), with the lines' own code
// (Shared/Lyrics/KaraokeLines), and from here it gets the song's lines and its clock.
//
// The lines: as a song begins, "pending" is posted, and once its lines are kept (SGKaraokeLinesKeptNotification) they
// are written with the lyrics page's look (SGLyricsLookPlist, and the Lyrics page's romanized lines, word sweep and
// delay) and the song's tag to one file of Spotify's caches, kSGLockLyricsName, which SpringBoard copies where
// MediaRemoteUI can read it; a song with no timed lines gets "none". A song nobody asked lyrics for, with the app in
// the background, has them asked for here. A change of the look, or new lines for the song (a translation), writes the
// file again.
//
// The clock: the position, speed and whether the song plays, with the song's tag, in the state of a notification
// (SGLockLyricsClock), posted as the song starts, stops, seeks or changes speed and every few seconds while it plays;
// MediaRemoteUI runs it on from when it hears it, so the lines keep to the song without a timer here.
//
// A tap on a line there seeks the song: MediaRemoteUI posts the position in a notification's state
// (kSGRelayLockLyricsSeek), and it is taken here as the lyrics page's tap is.
//
// Threading: main queue, but the file's writing, which has a queue of its own.
