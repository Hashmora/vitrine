// Music Haptics > Everywhere, with a jailbreak: the mod's own Music Haptics carried on while Spotify is not in front
// (the home screen, other apps, the lock screen), where iOS plays no haptics for an app in the background. Spotify
// keeps listening to its own sound and hands each tap and each level of the rumble to SpringBoard, which is always in
// front and plays them. The SpringBoard side is an add-on package of its own, Vitrine Addon (addons/haptics), installed
// once with a package manager on a jailbroken phone: Vitrine's IPA lives in Spotify's sandbox and has no way into
// SpringBoard. The IPA build lays the add-on's .deb inside Spotify.app (scripts/pipeline.sh), and the page hands that
// file to the package manager through the system's Open In (Sileo and Filza both take a .deb that way), so installing it
// is two taps, and the only way it is offered. An install of Vitrine's .deb alone has no copy inside Spotify: there the
// page says the IPA carries it. Everywhere is offered on a jailbroken phone; nothing plays behind Spotify
// until the add-on answers.
//
// The add-on answers with its build number (kSGRelayAddonBuild, raised whenever addons/haptics changes) as the state of
// its pong, so a copy inside Spotify newer than the one installed is offered as an update.
//
// The two talk by Darwin notifications, which a sandboxed app may post and which carry no payload: the value is in the
// name. A tap is one of kSGRelayLevels intensities times kSGRelaySharpnesses sharpnesses, the rumble one of
// kSGRelayLevels levels or 0 for quiet. Spotify posts each at the moment it is to be felt, so SpringBoard plays it at
// once. Spotify asks whether SpringBoard is there with a ping; SpringBoard answers with a pong, and posts one as it
// starts too, so whichever comes up second is heard.
//
// Threading: the posts are made from any thread; the answer is taken on the main queue.

// 3: the full-screen cover on the lock screen below iOS 26 (kSGRelayLockArtOn).
// 4: the track's moving artwork there in place of the still cover (kSGRelayLockClip), and no skeleton cover.
// 5: Vitrine Addon (the package renamed, com.vitrine.addon replacing com.vitrine.haptics), the clip fitted on the blurred
//    cover and played with no audio session, and the still cover's switch switch.
// 6: the lock screen's artwork gone while the song is paused.
// 7: that behind a switch of its own.
// 8: the cover and the clip fitted to the width on bands of their edges' colours, and a pause that fades them whole.
// 9: the clip only in place of the lock screen's own large cover, opened by a tap on the player's; the two switches of
//    before gone, the clip's edges faded into its bands, held still while paused.
// 10: the lock screen's tree dumped to the system log as it changes, to read its classes off a phone.
// 11: the tree's dumps and the hook on every view's layout taken out, the lock screen walked at most twice a second
//     and only with a clip to show.
// 12: loaded into MediaRemoteUI too, which draws the lock screen's player, to say what its views are.
// 13: the clip in place of the large cover inside MediaRemoteUI, handed over by SpringBoard, which hides the widgets
//     under the clock as it shows; no tree walked or dumped.
// 14: the large cover held hidden under the clip whatever alpha MediaRemoteUI gives it, and a tap that closes it gives
//     the cover back to shrink into the player while the clip fades.
// 15: a song with no clip gets its still cover the screen's width across too; the clip rests while the screen is dark
//     and starts over on a new display layer when it lights or its decoding fails.

//     with a button in its corner between them and the Canvas.
// 18: nothing of the lyrics made while MediaRemoteUI loads the add-on: 17 made their view there, hung MediaRemoteUI's
//     launch until its watchdog killed it, and the lock screen showed no player.
// 19: the button in the lock screen player's header; the lyrics scroll by hand and seek on a tap, on a dark blur of the
//     Canvas, and the large cover closes only on a tap on itself with the lyrics off.
// 20: the drags and taps over the lyrics caught by SpringBoard, which gets every touch over the large cover, and handed
//     to MediaRemoteUI, which draws it.
// 21: the Canvas branch's 17 taken in: Spotify's gray placeholder picture told from a song's cover, so a new song waits
