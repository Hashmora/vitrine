// Music Haptics > Everywhere, with a jailbreak: the mod's own Music Haptics carried on while Spotify is not in front
// (the home screen, other apps, the lock screen), where iOS plays no haptics for an app in the background. Spotify
// keeps listening to its own sound and hands each tap and each level of the rumble to SpringBoard, which is always in
// front and plays them. The SpringBoard side is an add-on package of its own, Vitrine Addon (addons/haptics), installed
// once with a package manager on a jailbroken phone: Vitrine's IPA lives in Spotify's sandbox and has no way into
// SpringBoard. The IPA build lays the add-on's .deb inside Spotify.app (scripts/pipeline.sh), and the page hands that
// file to the package manager through the system's Open In (Sileo and Filza both take a .deb that way), so installing it
// is two taps, and the only way it is offered. An install of Vitrine's .deb alone has no copy inside Spotify: there the
// page says the IPA carries it. Everywhere is offered on a jailbroken phone; nothing plays behind Spotify
// until the add-on answers.
//
// The add-on answers with its build number (kSGRelayAddonBuild, raised whenever addons/haptics changes) as the state of
// its pong, so a copy inside Spotify newer than the one installed is offered as an update.
//
// The two talk by Darwin notifications, which a sandboxed app may post and which carry no payload: the value is in the
// name. A tap is one of kSGRelayLevels intensities times kSGRelaySharpnesses sharpnesses, the rumble one of
// kSGRelayLevels levels or 0 for quiet. Spotify posts each at the moment it is to be felt, so SpringBoard plays it at
// once. Spotify asks whether SpringBoard is there with a ping; SpringBoard answers with a pong, and posts one as it
// starts too, so whichever comes up second is heard.
//
// Threading: the posts are made from any thread; the answer is taken on the main queue.
